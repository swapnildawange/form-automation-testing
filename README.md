# form-automation-testing

### Questions
#### 1. While testing any UI it is very important to ensure that the UI is responsive and that the user can interact with it.To just automate the testing of the UI, it is not possible to test the responsiveness of the UI.

#### 2. How do you test the UI changes when the test automation changes the value of a form field?
##### Ex. When the test automation enters a value in a form filed we have to ensure that the value is properly visible in the UI.Text is not overflowing , it is not truncated, it is not hidden, also if the value is incorrect there maybe another error message or styling applied to the form which is not possible to test through automation.
